# UI Design & Layout

## Desktop Interface
The UI is built with Dioxus and rendered via a system WebView.

### Main Components
- **Header**: Contains the app logo and synchronization status.
- **Clipboard History**: A scrollable list of captured clipboard items.
- **Item Detail**: (Planned) Viewing full content and metadata for selected items.
- **Settings**: Configuration for sync, notifications, and security.

### Aesthetics
- **Theme**: Dark mode by default with vibrant accents.
- **Animations**: Subtle transitions for list updates and window state changes.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout adjusts to different window sizes.

## Mobile Interface
(Planned) Adaptive layout optimized for touch interaction, prioritizing quick access to recent history.
